# Introduction

Bell Jar is a tool for neurohistology analysis of the mouse brain. It is still under active development.

# Compatability

Bell Jar's goal is be built on any platform, however, due to current dependency issues within the python enviornment it is not possible to build on arm64 based machines. We're working to resolve the issue but in the meantime know that the install will fail in that case.

# Install

To build and run from source please clone the main branch onto your local machine and run the following. Note that complete install requires internet and about 55GB of storage.

```
// Install all dependencies
yarn install

// Run the Electron app
yarn start
```
